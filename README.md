# My Chip 8 Emulator / Interpreter
- This is my first try at making the Chip 8 Emulator
- While making I faced a few challenges but well written articles and video tutorials really helped me complete
- This is just the original Chip 8 without any of the quirks or any of the intstructions of the superchip
- This was a fun project and I learned about SDL and a bit about emulating instructions
- Sound was the major time taking component, and also copy pasting a lot of code because of some poor design decisions made
- I learnt the importnace of understanding bit manipulation and bit masking in this area
- A lot of time was also spent on just getting C++ to print things the way I wanted it to 
- The final part was removing bugs and flaws in the implemenation of the Emulator which thankfully were few but took the last major portion of programming this
